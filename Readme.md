- **ECS Game Architecture Repository Overview:**

  This repository is designed as a practical exploration of the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture within the context of game development. It serves as a template or starting point for building games based on the ECS pattern, which emphasizes separation of concerns, flexibility, and efficient performance.

- **Key Features:**
  - **ECS Framework:** Implements a basic but comprehensive ECS framework tailored for game development.
  - **Component-Based Design:** Includes components such as `Network`, `PlayerType`, `Position`, `Texture`, and `TileMap` for modular game entity construction.
  - **System-Driven Logic:** Features systems like `AnimationHandler`, `Movement`, `Render`, and more to process entities based on their components.
  - **Scene Management:** Utilizes a scene management system to organize game levels and environments.
  - **Resource Management:** Incorporates a texture manager for efficient loading and handling of graphical assets.

- **Technologies and Tools:**
  - **C++:** The primary programming language used for developing the game architecture, providing the necessary performance and flexibility.
  - **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer):** A cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. Used for rendering graphics and handling input/events in the game.

- **Architecture Highlights:**
  - **Modularity:** The ECS architecture allows for highly modular development, making it easier to add, modify, or remove features without affecting unrelated parts of the codebase.
  - **Performance:** By separating data and logic, the ECS pattern can lead to performance optimizations, particularly in systems where entity interactions are complex and frequent.
  - **Scalability:** Designed to scale, the architecture supports the development of games with varying complexity, from simple 2D puzzles to more complex 3D environments.
